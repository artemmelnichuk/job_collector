"""LLM-drafted CV bullets + short application pitch (plan item 8.2).

Complements `core/fit_score.py` in the same "billed, explicitly-invoked
script" family - not part of the free collect/analyze pass. Deliberately
NOT a full formal cover letter: the candidate's own existing hand-written
drafts (`CV/application_drafts_round*.md`) are short, dry, factual
first-person paragraphs naming concrete tools/employers and relocation
stance, not a generic "Dear Hiring Manager" letter - this generates in
that same established style, not a new one.

    "experience that is ALREADY in the CV. Never invent an employer, job "
    "title, tool, skill, degree, certification, date, or achievement that "
    "isn't there. If the posting wants something the CV doesn't show, leave "

    "'based' anywhere other than the CV header's stated current location. "
    "Never write 'based in [the posting's country]' or 'originally from "
    "[a past employer's country]' - a past employer's country is work "
    "history, not a claim about where the candidate lives now. A genuine, "
    "verifiable time-zone-overlap fact IS fine to state (e.g. the "
    "candidate's real country is only ~1 hour from Ukraine's time zone) "
    "since it's true and relevant to a remote posting - just don't dress it "
