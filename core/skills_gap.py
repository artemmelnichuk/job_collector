"""Skill-gap and rejection-reason analysis over the reviewed vacancy dataset.

Answers a different question than core/analyzer.py: not "what does this one
posting need" but "across everything I've already judged, what keeps costing
me otherwise-plausible roles, and which of the missing skills shows up often
enough to be worth learning". Reads jobs_master (required_skills/
preferred_skills, from analyzer.py) joined with manual_review (decision,
should_be_filtered, main_reason, review_notes, from human/best-guess review).
